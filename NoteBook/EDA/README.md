### 1. Introduction

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach/philosophy for data analysis that employs a variety of techniques (mostly graphical) to

- maximize insight into a data set.
- uncover underlying structure.
- extract important variables.
- detect outliers and anomalies.
- test underlying assumptions.
- develop parsimonious models.
- determine optimal factor settings.

### 2. Objective

- To get familiar with the features in our dataset.
- Generally understand the core characteristics of our dataset.
- Explore the data relationships of all the features and understand how the featurescompare to the response variable.
- Consider fascinating figures and graphs that may be developed to assist us better grasp the data.

### 3. Initial Statistics Summary

Generate descriptive statistics.

Descriptive statistics include those that summarize the central tendency, dispersion and shape of a datasetâ€™s distribution, excluding `NaN` values.

Analyzes both numeric and object series, as well as `DataFrame` column sets of mixed data types. The output will vary depending on what is provided. Refer to the notes below for more detail.
